**TASK 2**

**Objective of the Recipe Finder Application:**
The objective of the Recipe Finder application is to provide users with an easy and efficient way to discover and explore a variety of recipes based on their search preferences. 
By leveraging the Edamam Recipe API, the application fetches and displays detailed recipe information, including images, ingredients, and calorie content.
The aim is to offer a user-friendly and visually appealing platform where users can quickly find inspiration for their meals, access cooking instructions, 
and explore new culinary ideas. This project demonstrates the integration of API data with front-end web technologies, enhancing the user experience through responsive design and interactive features.
